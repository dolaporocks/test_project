# test_project

A Flutter Project that I created alongsides some team members of ours for my capstone on behalf of a client. This project was created to meet the needs of parents and daycare providers,
For parents who are looking to connect with various types of daycare providers and daycare providers who are finding it hard to get a job. 
It's a responsive web application set to work and respond with various screen sizes ranging from small phones to Ipads and desktops.  
They are able to create a profile, search for various people on the site and also have access to blog posts that the admin user posts on a 
regular basis. 
This was created with the use of Flutter and Dart and we used Firebase for storing our data collection as it makes the process much easier 
and faster for the admin handling and managing the process even without a technology background. 
There is definitely a lot of potential for this project but it helped me broaden and gain more experience with the use of Flutter and Dart. 
Flutter makes it easy to not only create mobile apps, but responsive web apps and you are also able to design the pages to fit the needs of 
the client.
